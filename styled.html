<p> Freestyle is the most basic style of swimming you can have. It is relatively easy and when I first started swimming, it was the first stroke I learned. 
</p> 
<p>It is done by simply putting one arm forward and back continuously, switching between your right and left. Every 2 or so strokes (it changes depending on how fast you want to go) you turn your head to the arm you are moving and breathe. For the legs, you keep kicking up and down, and each leg should move asynchronously. </p>

<p> Backstroke, is probably even easier than freestyle. This is the second stroke I learned and it is just the reverse version of freestyle. </p>
<p>It is done exactly like freestyle but literally just on your back. In fact this time you don't need to care about your breathing because you will have unlimited air. Very boring. </p>

	<p> We have finally arrived at my favorite stroke. With breaststroke you will sometimes feel like you're not moving anywhere but you always get to your destination. It is a little complex but doesn't require too much energy to move far.</p>
	<p>The arms move in an almost circular movement, the left moves to the left in a circle and the right to the right. they meet at your breast, move up a bit, and then back to the circular motions. Every time they meet at your breast you bring your chest up and breathe. For the legs, they move in a frog like fashion, up and bending and then straight and together.</p>

	<p>Finally, Butterfly is here. Though I don't swim anymore I still remember the pain from doing butterfly. It leaves you breathless, it is definitely the most energy consuming out of all the strokes. It is nothing like the gracefull flight of a butterfly, it is arm swinging terror. </p>
	<p>The arm motions in butterfly are similar to windmills, though it is definitely not the entire motion. You breathe when ever your hands are in the back and not in front of your body. The legs move in something called, "dolphin kick", it moves very much like how a mermaid would, you move both legs at the same time, up and down.
