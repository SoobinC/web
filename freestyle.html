	<p> Freestyle is the most basic style of swimming you can have. It is relatively easy and when I first started swimming, it was the first stroke I learned. 
    </p> 
	<p>It is done by simply putting one arm forward and back continuously, switching between your right and left. Every 2 or so strokes (it changes depending on how fast you want to go) you turn your head to the arm you are moving and breathe. For the legs, you keep kicking up and down, and each leg should move asynchronously. 
	</p>
	<p> However, no matter how good my explanation may seem I am actually not a coach. But for a visual and better explanation you can look here: </p>

	<p> While not being the hardest, freestyle can really get you anywhere. It's fast and efficient. You actually burn the second most amount of calories among all the strokes in freestyle. You burn 488 calories for an 185 pound person swimming for 30 minutes. 
	</p>

	<p> It's really a personal preference though, when I was young, and still swimming freestyle, it just did not work well with me. From what I remember about freestyle, half is power and half is your form. I didn't have great form so no matter how much energy I put in I was always very slow at it.
