<p> Freestyle is the most basic style of swimming you can have. It is relatively easy and when I first started swimming, it was the first stroke I learned. 
</p> 
<p>It is done by simply putting one arm forward and back continuously, switching between your right and left. Every 2 or so strokes (it changes depending on how fast you want to go) you turn your head to the arm you are moving and breathe. For the legs, you keep kicking up and down, and each leg should move asynchronously. </p>
