	<p> Backstroke, is probably even easier than freestyle. This is the second stroke I learned and it is just the reverse version of freestyle. 
	</p>

	<p>It is done exactly like freestyle but literally just on your back. In fact this time you don't need to care about your breathing because you will have unlimited air. Very boring.

	<p> While being the easiest I don't think some people would willingly chose to swim backstroke. I think above all else it can very dangerous to swim backstroke in the ocean due to the waves. You are not in control of your breathing in backstroke, the water around you is.

	<p> In terms of calories it is the third highest calorie burner, it burns about 250 calories for 30 minutes. 
	</p>
	<p> Perhaps I am only giving you this advice from personal experience, I just remember drinking a lot of water while doing backstroke. It is also hard to remain focused on swimming when you can see the top of a swimming pool or the sky.
