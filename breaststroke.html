	<p> We have finally arrived at my favorite stroke. With breaststroke you will sometimes feel like you're not moving anywhere but you always get to your destination. It is a little complex but doesn't require too much energy to move far.
	</p>

	<p>The arms move in an almost circular movement, the left moves to the left in a circle and the right to the right. they meet at your breast, move up a bit, and then back to the circular motions. Every time they meet at your breast you bring your chest up and breathe. For the legs, they move in a frog like fashion, up and bending and then straight and together.
	</p>

	<p> This is how you do breaststroke but you didn't hear it from me. If you really want to learn, here is it:

	<p> Though not being the most intense stroke breaststroke has its merits in its slowness. You barely feel tired and in turn you could burn more calories doing breaststroke for a longer period of time. Moderation is key, if you don't think you could do an hour of butterfly at least do an hour of breaststroke. </p>
	<p> For the calories burned, about 200 calories for 30 minutes of swimming 
	</p> 
	<p> I personally like breaststroke the best, however I know some people could find it too slow, and anxiety inducing. It's like going in slow-mo, if you would like a relaxing swim this is the stroke, if you want to feel intensity then this isn't it.
