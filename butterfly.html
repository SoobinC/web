	<p>Finally, Butterfly is here. Though I don't swim anymore I still remember the pain from doing butterfly. It leaves you breathless, it is definitely the most energy consuming out of all the strokes. It is nothing like the gracefull flight of a butterfly, it is arm swinging terror.      </p>
	<p>The arm motions in butterfly are similar to windmills, though it is definitely not the entire motion. You breathe when every your hands are in the back and not in front of your body. The legs move in something called, "dolphin kick", it moves very much like how a mermaid would, you move both legs at the same time, up and down.

	<p> Though this explanation is very close to perfect, alas it is not. For a far superior explanation look here:

		<p> You will only ever swim butterfly if you are crazy. It is a very, very intense stroke. You will feel very tired after a few minutes of doing butterfly, I wouldn't start with this stroke if you are just starting out, it'll wear you out very fast. </p>
		<p> As warned before, butterfly is hard but it will burn you the most calories. It is about 450 calories for 30 minutes of swimming </p> 
		<p> My own experiences with butterfly have been very mixed, there are times where my limbs felt like they would fall off and there were times where it felt like I was flying. The adrenaline rush is such a great motivator but to get to that place you need to push through the toughness first. </p>
